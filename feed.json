            "content_html": "<p>APPEARANCE IS ONE THING, REALITY ANOTHER</p><p>The people who astonish me the most in life are those who say, “I believe what I see.” Because appearance is the area where human beings are most mistaken and pass the most erroneous judgments. According to the principle, “It may be that what you think is good is actually bad for you, and what you think is bad is actually good for you,” one should not be hasty in judgment.</p><p>In <em>Fusūs al-Ḥikam</em>, the chapter on Moses fundamentally explains the difference between appearance and reality. The life of Moses (peace be upon him) is full of evidence showing that appearance and reality can be entirely different. First, we encounter the figure of Pharaoh, who says, “I am your most exalted lord.” Yet it is God who granted exaltedness to Moses. The chapter of Moses speaks of the “Wisdom of Exaltation.” According to Ibn al-‘Arabī, exaltedness is Moses’s most distinctive attribute. Yet Pharaoh, looking at Moses’s speech impediment, said to his people, “Is this man who can hardly express what he wants better, or am I?” In appearance, the one with difficulty speaking seemed inferior, but in reality it was the exact opposite. Appearance was temporary; reality was enduring…</p><p>Pharaoh was slaughtering the children of the Children of Israel for what he thought was a reason threatening his dominion. In appearance, this was a great evil for the Children of Israel. But according to Ibn al-‘Arabī, the soul of every child killed as “a Moses” was joined to Moses, gathering in him as strength and power. In truth, this was a good for them. Through this, they became the community of a prophet of great resolve like Moses. Moreover, this sacrifice was so blessed that they became, far beyond the number of the children they lost, the most populous community after the community of Muhammad. We know that during the Mi‘rāj even the Prophet looked upon their multitude with admiration. This was a great rank.</p><p>This also points, for us, to how individual souls are represented within a collective spiritual personality; how even if they outwardly disappear, they live on within it; how apparent annihilation is in fact a kind of permanence. If we were to melt our ego—like a piece of ice—and join the river, even if we vanished outwardly, in truth we would continue our journey not as a piece of ice but as a river. God gives back, many times over, what He takes as a sacrifice—if only we could truly comprehend it…</p><p>Pharaoh kept the Children of Israel under his rule by saying, “We have an overpowering, crushing force over them.” This is what appeared to be the case. Yet the true Owner of the Children of Israel was God; He held Egypt, Pharaoh, and the entire world in His hand. He was the Subduer (al-Qahhār) and the All-Powerful (al-Qadīr). Pharaoh would come to see this over time through events such as the locusts, the frogs, the water turning to blood, the death of the firstborn, and the splitting of the sea. The crushing power he took such pleasure in boasting about would explode upon his own head.</p><p>Pharaoh had magicians—skilled, masters of all the sciences and magic of their time. Moses, on the other hand, knew nothing of magic; it was known both to Pharaoh and to the magicians that he had no such knowledge. When they cast what they were to cast, it seemed that Moses would be disgraced. But reality did not unfold that way. For in truth, the verse “You did not throw when you threw, but God threw” was also operative in Moses. God’s hand was above Moses’s hand.</p><p>Moses (peace be upon him) was seeking fire in the desert for his family. According to him, what he needed was fire; they were cold. God was merciful and manifested to him according to his need—but when he reached the fire, he found Him in the fire. He was speaking to him; He was the Speaker (al-Mutakallim). The Divine Name al-Mutakallim continued to manifest upon Moses forever. So much so that the Children of Israel would ask Moses, whenever they felt like it, even the most detailed matters, saying, “Ask this of your Lord.” No one doubted that Moses was in continual conversation with his Lord. Yet once they had called him “the man who cannot speak.”</p><p>Moses’s journey of encountering Khidr also helps us understand the difference between appearance and reality, as does his rough treatment of his brother without waiting for an explanation when he descended from Sinai and found his people worshipping an idol. What angered Moses was, in appearance, Aaron’s (peace be upon him) seeming to stand by while his people worshipped the idol. But in reality, we learn that Aaron had admonished them yet could not make them listen; he did not intervene harshly because he feared causing discord among the people. Here too, appearance and reality diverge.</p><p>Many proofs can be found regarding the difference between appearance and reality, but in the chapter of Moses the matter continues with the statement, “The outward bears a trace of the inward.” This reflects the Shaykh’s way of saying: “Appearance is different from reality, yet it is not entirely opposed to it.” The relationship between appearance and reality is essentially like that between a dream and its interpretation. If we take the appearance entirely as reality, we mistake the dream itself for reality. If we cast it aside altogether, we fail to see what the dream wishes to tell us. The concept that emerges here is <em>i‘tibār</em>. <em>I‘tibār</em> comes from the same root as <em>ta‘bīr</em> (interpretation). It reminds us of the Prophet Joseph, to whom the interpretation of events (<em>ta’wīl al-aḥādīth</em>) was given. Interpreting events is a matter of wisdom. And wisdom does not come in haste. Sometimes the path of wisdom, like Joseph’s path, passes through the well, being sold, slavery, trials of chastity, and prison. Wisdom is a matter of patience and deliberation. Reaching reality from appearance likewise requires a long and careful journey.</p><p>Haste is embedded in human nature. But human beings are not condemned to it. To be able to step from appearance toward reality, to attain wisdom, one must first say, “There is wisdom in everything He does; whatever happens is surely for good,” and submit. Every question asked after submission is a step taken toward wisdom and truth. Questioning after submission is beautiful; it leads a person from imitation to verification. Not being satisfied with mere description of a claim, seeking proof, should not be understood as dissatisfaction. After all, God is the One who answers (al-Mujīb); He responds to questions and answers the call—provided one is willing to pay the price that truth deserves and to wait.</p><p>To return to the beginning: those who believe only what they see, whose intellect has descended into their eyes, unfortunately depart from life having truly seen very little.</p>",
